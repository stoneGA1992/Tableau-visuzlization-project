	## Data Overview
	This data was pulled from April 2018, 2019, and 2020 for Jersey City. 


## Trip Duration by Age

When looking at the information presented the highest average trip duration is with people born in 1939. The average for this birth year 35,422. However on closer inspection of the number of records you can see that there are only two entries for 1939, which is pulling the average duration way up for this year. The highest average after excluding this year belongs to 1969 with an average of 4,508 for 3,362 records. 

After that the general trend is that the younger the person, the higher the average trip duration. 

## Ridership growth

The total number of trips declined for the month of April vs 2019. Last year the number of trips was 23,606 while for this year the number stands at 17,719. The overall decline in trips could possibly be attributed to the decline in subscribers. From 2019 to 2020, subscribers dropped from 95% of the total user base to 85%. The overall count of subscribers also dropped from 22.5k to 15k. This is the largest contributor to the drop in ridership. While its impossible for exactly nail down the reasons why with the data we have available to us, it could possibly be assumed that COVID-19 could have a negative impact on subscribers.

## Gender demographics over time

Within this dataset Gender is denoted by three numbers: Zero=unknown; 1=male; 2=female. Over three years there has been an overall decline in ridership. Of the overall ridership the largest decline has been in male riders, which has just hit a three year low for April. Female riders on the other hand have grown overall over the three-year span despite being down from 2019 to 2020. April 2020 was only down -551 female riders vs LY vs male riders being down -5,790 vs LY. For whatever reason female riders have remained much steadier than males which have dropped off significantly.

## Most Popular Starting and ending stations

What is immediately obvious is that the most popular station is Grove St path. This is the same for the ending locations. One reason for this could be due to the type of trips that riders are taking from these locations. The top four starting locations all have lower average trip durations compared to other stations. This could mean that Grove St is within close enough proximity to enough things that riders are more willing to take bike rides compared to taking the train or getting a Taxi.
